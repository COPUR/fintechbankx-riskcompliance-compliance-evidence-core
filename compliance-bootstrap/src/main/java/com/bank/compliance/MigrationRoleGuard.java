/**
 * Refuses the single-user fallback (decision 0002). When both
 * DB_MIGRATION_USERNAME (the schema owner, from the db-migration secret) and
 * DB_USERNAME (the runtime role the chart sets and V7 grants) are known, they
 * must name different roles: equal names mean the migration secret holds the
 * runtime credential, Flyway would migrate as the role the service connects
 * with, V7 would grant the owner to itself and the insert-only guarantee would
 * not hold. Without DB_MIGRATION_USERNAME (service pods, local runs) nothing
 * is checked. PostgreSQL folds unquoted names to lower case, so the comparison
 * ignores case. The message names the properties, never a value.
 *
 * <p>A BeanFactoryPostProcessor, so it runs before the datasource and Flyway
 * beans exist ({@link FlywayStartupConfiguration}): the migration Job exits 1
 * without connecting.
